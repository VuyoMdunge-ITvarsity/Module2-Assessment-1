                            <h3>TIGER</h3>
    <p>Tigers are the largest cats in the world, with adult males, known as "toms" or "tigers," typically weighing between 220 to 660 pounds (100 to 300 kilograms), depending on the subspecies. Females, known as "queens" or "tigresses," are generally smaller, with weights ranging from 143 to 400 pounds (65 to 180 kilograms). Tigers have a muscular build, powerful jaws, and retractable claws. Their fur is typically orange with black stripes, although white tigers with pale fur and black stripes are also known to exist.</p>
     <p>Tigers inhabit a variety of habitats, including tropical forests, mangrove swamps, grasslands, and mountainous regions. They are adaptable animals capable of surviving in diverse environments, provided there is sufficient prey and access to water. Tigers are often associated with dense forests and are solitary animals that require large home ranges to meet their needs.</p>
   <p>Tigers are apex predators and are primarily carnivorous, with a diet that includes a wide range of prey species. Their preferred prey varies depending on their habitat but commonly includes deer, wild boar, water buffalo, and other large mammals. Tigers are ambush predators that rely on stealth and strength to catch their prey, often hunting at night when visibility is low. They are capable of taking down prey much larger than themselves and are known to be powerful and efficient killers.</p>
