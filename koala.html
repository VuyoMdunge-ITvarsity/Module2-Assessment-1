                            <h3>KOALA</h3>
    <p>Koalas are iconic marsupials native to Australia, known for their distinctive appearance, arboreal lifestyle, and preference for eucalyptus leaves as their primary food source.</p>
     <p>Koalas are commonly known for their adorable and fluffy ears, large noses and their stout bear-like body.They have thick, woolly fur that varies in color from gray to brown, with white fur on their chests and fluffy ears. They have strong, clawed limbs adapted for climbing trees, and their hands and feet have two opposable digits that help them grip branches. </p>
   <p>A koala is a specialized herbivore that feeds almost exclusively on the leaves of eucalyptus trees. They have a highly specialized digestive system that allows them to detoxify the chemicals found in eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to many other animals. Koalas are known to be highly selective in their choice of eucalyptus species and will often have preferences for certain types of leaves..</p>
     <p> Koalas are found in the eucalypt forests and woodlands of eastern and southeastern Australia, primarily in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. They inhabit a range of forest types but prefer areas with plenty of eucalyptus trees.</p>
