                            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
    <p>Warthogs have a robust, stocky build with disproportionately large heads and elongated snouts. Their most distinctive features are the pairs of large tusks protruding from the sides of their mouths, which curve upwards and are used for defense against predators and for digging up roots and tubers. Warthogs also have two pairs of warts on their faces, with the largest pair located beneath their eyes. These warts are made of tough, fibrous tissue and serve as protection during fights..</p>
     <p>Warthogs are found in a variety of habitats across sub-Saharan Africa, including savannas, grasslands, woodlands, and scrublands. They are particularly common in areas with access to water sources, as they rely on water for drinking and wallowing to regulate their body temperature and protect themselves from parasites.</p>
   <p>Warthogs are omnivores with a diet that primarily consists of grasses, roots, tubers, bulbs, and other vegetation. They are also known to supplement their diet with insects, small mammals, bird eggs, and carrion. Warthogs are adapted for feeding on roots and tubers by using their strong snouts and tusks to dig up food from the ground.</p>
