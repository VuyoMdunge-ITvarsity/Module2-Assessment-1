     <p>Monkeys have a wide range of physical characteristics depending on the species. However, they typically have long tails (although not prehensile in all species), opposable thumbs, and forward-facing eyes. They have excellent stereoscopic vision, which helps them judge distances accurately as they move through the trees. Monkeys are generally agile climbers and spend much of their time in the trees, although some species also spend time on the ground.</p>
