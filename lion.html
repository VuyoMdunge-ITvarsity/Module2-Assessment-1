                            <h3>LION</h3>
    <p>Lions are large carnivores with muscular bodies, strong jaws, and retractable claws. Adult males, known as "lions," are larger than females, known as "lionesses," and typically weigh between 330 to 550 pounds (150 to 250 kilograms), although individuals weighing over 600 pounds (270 kilograms) have been recorded. Male lions also have a distinctive mane of hair around their heads and necks, which varies in color from blond to black and serves as a symbol of dominance and sexual maturity.</p>
     <p>Lions inhabit a variety of habitats, including savannas, grasslands, scrublands, and open woodlands. They are adaptable animals capable of surviving in diverse environments, provided there is sufficient prey and access to water. Lions are often associated with the African savanna, where they are apex predators and play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem balance.</p>
   <p> Lions are apex predators and are primarily carnivorous, with a diet that includes a wide range of large and small mammals. Their prey varies depending on the availability of food in their habitat but commonly includes antelopes, zebras, wildebeests, buffalo, and giraffes. Lions are cooperative hunters, often hunting in groups known as prides, where they use teamwork and strategic coordination to take down large prey.</p>
