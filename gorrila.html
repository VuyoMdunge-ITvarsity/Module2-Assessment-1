                            <h3>GORILLA</h3>
    <p>Gorillas are divided into two species: the eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei) and the western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). Each species is further divided into two subspecies: the eastern gorilla includes the eastern lowland gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri) and the mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei), while the western gorilla includes the western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and the critically endangered Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli).</p>
     <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, with adult males, known as silverbacks due to the silver-gray hair on their backs, typically weighing between 300 to 500 pounds (135 to 227 kilograms) and standing up to 5.9 feet (1.8 meters) tall when upright. They have muscular builds, large hands with opposable thumbs, and long arms that are adapted for climbing and knuckle-walking on the ground. Gorillas have coarse, black hair covering most of their bodies, and their faces are hairless, with a distinctive ridge known as the sagittal crest on the forehead of adult males.</p>
   <p>Gorillas inhabit the dense forests of equatorial Africa, including rainforests, montane forests, and bamboo forests. They are primarily found in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Cameroon, Gabon, and Nigeria. Gorillas are highly adaptable to their forest habitats and can range from lowland areas to elevations of over 13,000 feet (4,000 meters) in some cases</p>
     <p>Gorillas are primarily herbivorous, feeding mainly on leaves, shoots, fruits, and stems. Their diet varies depending on the availability of food in their habitat and can include over 100 different plant species. Gorillas spend much of their day foraging for food, using their hands and powerful jaws to strip leaves from branches and crush tough vegetation.</p>
