                            <h3>RHINO-BEETLE</h3>
    <p>Rhino beetles are among the largest beetles in the world, with some species reaching lengths of up to 6 inches (15 centimeters), including their horns. The males typically have larger horns than females, and the size and shape of the horns vary between species. These horns are used for combat between males during mating contests and for burrowing into soil or decaying wood. Rhino beetles have robust bodies with hard exoskeletons and are often colored in shades of black, brown, or metallic hues.</p>
     <p>Rhino beetles are found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, with the highest diversity occurring in Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America. They inhabit diverse habitats such as forests, grasslands, and agricultural areas, where they feed on decaying organic matter, tree sap, and fruit.</p>
   <p>As larvae, rhino beetles are primarily detritivores, feeding on decaying plant material, compost, and rotting wood. Adults also feed on sap, nectar, and fruit, although their diet varies depending on the species. Some species are known to cause damage to crops such as sugarcane and coconut palms by feeding on plant tissues.</p>
